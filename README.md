# CS370_Pirate
This is the final project for SNHU CS 370

I attempted to write code that would have a pirate on a grid maze find the end. I was given the code to make the maze and the starting location of the pirate. I added code that would have the pirate find the end of the maze. It did not play well with the code.

Question 1: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
A computer scientist do many different things. They study how computers work and learn. In reference to this class, they push the boundaries of computer learning and what it can do.

Question 2: How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Logically. Having a background in mathematics I approach nearly everything logically.

Question 3: What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities are to ensure that they have the highest possible program without errors. Unfortunately, that is not the case as I have seen some poor programming.
